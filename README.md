**Highlight To Field**

This is an Anki addon that will update a field with the highlighted content in the anki card.

**Note** *that it is basically a personal project, by someone who is not particularly good at coding. It can give some errors if you missuse the addon (like using an invalid filter in the Fetch setting) but it shouldn't cause any harm in your anki. Don't expect consistent (if any) updates or proper support. I'll try to help if you find any problems or any suggestions if I have the time.*

*If you actually want to use it, remember it is provided "As is", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort or otherwise, arising from, out of or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.*
